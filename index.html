    <h2>Hi there!, I'm Jose Luis...</h2>
    <p>... I'm the funder of AeroStruct. I'm just a young aerospace engineering interested in new projects and learning, and that is the purpose of</p>
    <p>this blog, for learning and sharing.</p>
    <p>A little bit about me, I've been in the aerospace industry for over 6 years now, and I have been involved into the structural side of aircrafts</p>
    <p>I have worked for two different companies so far, Textron Aviation and Altitude Aerospace.</p>
    <p>I can understand that sometimes the information on internet can be difficult to find, or simply there are not enough, and thats why I decided</p>
    <p>to put work on my own page, to help having more information available as well to add my personal projects that at the end will have something</p>
    <p>to share. I hope this web page like you as much as I do, and if you would like to ask/request something special, feel free to hit me up on the </p>
    <p>"Contact" tab.</p>

    <p>You make the job as interesting as you want</p>
    <p>Cheers!</p>
